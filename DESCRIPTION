Description: The DBFMCL package (Density Based Filtering And Markov Clustering) implement a method for filtering and partionning a noisy dataset. DBF-MCL is a tree-step adaptative algorithm that (i) find elements located in dense areas (ie. clusters) (ii) uses selected items to construct a graph and (iii) performs graph partitioning using MCL.
