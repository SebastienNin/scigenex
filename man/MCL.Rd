\alias{MCL}
\title{Invokes the Markov CLustering algorithm (MCL).}
\usage{
MCL(name, inflation = 2, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{a character string corresponding to the file name.}

\item{inflation}{the main control of MCL. Inflation affects cluster
granularity. It is usually chosen somewhere in the range \code{[1.2-5.0]}.
\code{inflation = 5.0} will tend to result in fine-grained clusterings, and
whereas \code{inflation = 1.2} will tend to result in very coarse grained
clusterings. By default, \code{inflation = 2.0}. Default setting gives very
good results for microarray data when k is set around 100.}

\item{silent}{if set to TRUE, the progression of the MCL partitionning is
not displayed.}
}
\value{
Returns a file with the ".mcl\_out.txt" extension.
}
\description{
This function invokes the mcl system command. MCL is a clustering algorithm
for graphs that was developped by Stijn van Dongen (see references for
further informations).
}
\section{warning}{
 Works only on UNIX-like plateforms. MCL should be
installed. The following command lines can be used for installation.

\code{# Download the latest version of mcl (RTools4TB has been tested
successfully with the 06-058 version).}
\code{wget http://micans.org/mcl/src/mcl-latest.tar.gz}
\code{# Uncompress and install mcl}
\code{tar xvfz mcl-latest.tar.gz}
\code{cd mcl-xx-xxx}
\code{./configure}
\code{make}
\code{sudo make install}
\code{# You should get mcl in your path}
\code{mcl -h}
}
